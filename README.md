## Introduction

In recent years, [MathWork's MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) added [Python support](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html). This unlocks the capabilities of the powerful open source scientific Python ecosystem inside MATLAB. This post provides a tutorial on how to use [Insight Toolkit (ITK)](https://itk.org) version 5.3 and newer and [itkwasm](https://wasm.itk.org) Python packages in MATLAB.

[ITK](https://itk.org) is an open-source, cross-platform library that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis.  Developed through extreme programming methodologies, ITK builds on a proven, spatially-oriented architecture for processing, segmentation, and registration of scientific images in two, three, or more dimensions.
